## Introduction
In this blog post, we will discuss the development of a web interface using React.js to integrate the previously built pipeline for time-series anomaly detection and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation. This interface will allow users to interact with the model, visualize results, and make informed decisions based on the outputs of the GMMs, Autoencoders, and ReAct loop powered by the Ollama Multiagent System.
